💖 Philosophy
Recovery isn't one-size-fits-all. Daybreak recognizes that:

Meditation isn't for everyone (especially early in recovery)
Community matters, but privacy matters more
Small wins deserve celebration
Some days are harder than others—and that's okay
You deserve tools that respect your journey
